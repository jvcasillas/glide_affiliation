# Syllabic affiliation of glides in chicano

## Participants

- p01: incomplete
- p02: incomplete
- p03: complete (203 tokens)
- p04: incomplete (202 tokens, 1 missing)
- p05: complete (203 tokens)
- p06: incomplete (130 tokens, 73 missing)
- p07: incomplete (201 tokens, 2 missing)
- p08: incomplete (91 tokens, 112 missing)

Total tokens: 1030  

Total missing: 594
(8 participants x 203 itmes = 1624)  
1624 items - 1030 tokens = 594 missing

## Notes

- p01 and p02 did a different version of the experiment
	- no carrier sentences
	- less items
- p03:p08 completed an updated version of the experiment administered with 
'stim2.pptx'
	- includes carrier sentences
	- includes real and nonce words
	- includes syllabification task

## Coding and segmentation

### Carrier sentence task

- Target syllables are analyzed by segments
- The onset of prevocalic glides was determined by locating the intensity valley 
after the syllable onset. 
- The beginning of the syllable nucleus was defined as the point in which 
formant trajectories became steady, before peak intensity was reached. 
- The beginning of the offglide was defined as the point in which formant 
trajectories began changing once again, usually accompanied by a decrease in 
intensity. 
- Misread target words are labelled as 'error'
- For all segments the following metrics are calculated: 
  - F0, F1, F2, and F3 values over the time course of the segment in 10% 
  increments
  - Total segment duration

### Syllabification task

- Target words are segmented by syllables and the duration is calculated
- If a hiatus is pronounced in critical syllables then the final column
is coded as 'extra' (extra syllable) in the textgrid
- if the syllable is altered in a way that reduces the phonotactic 
structure (to avoid illegal phonotactics?) the final column is coded 
as 'error' in the textgrid
- if the participant produced something that has nothing to do with the 
item then the final column is coded as 'wayoff'
- otherwise the final tier of the textfrid is coded as NA, which indicates a 
tripthong
